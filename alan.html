Get it right and not only will you secure an investor, you’ll secure a partner” says Annika Small, CEO at Nominet Trust.</p>
	<p>This exercise will help you collate the outputs from previous modules and represent them in the form of a resilient proposition for investors. The document that you will be supported to produce will assess the potential market for your idea, including: demand, scalability, income generation models, potential competitors/partners/investors as well as any potential social return on investment.</p>
